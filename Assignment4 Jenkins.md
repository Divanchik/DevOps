## Assignment 4 - Jenkins

### Jenkins Docs:
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/

### Steps
1. Prepare and run Jenkins instance (download and run Jenkins-Bitnami vm image or Jenkins container, or install with installer for linux distro - your choice)
2. Read docs and create Pipline, which have to:
* grab (clone) sources from any git-repo
* compile sources or build
* displays if previous steps (compilation/building) succesfull/failed. Actually Jenkins does it automatically, whatever.
